## What are data frames and tibbles?

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for tabular data in `R`, and what
we use for data processing, statistics, and plotting.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Data frames are analogous to
the more familiar spreadsheet in programs such as Excel, with one key difference.
Because columns are vectors,
each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![A 3 by 3 data frame with columns showing numeric, character and logical values.](fig/data-frame.svg)

As shown in the previous lesson data frames can be created by hand, but most 
commonly they are generated by the functions eg. `read_csv()` or `read_table()` 
- in other words, by importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web). 
We will now demonstrate how to import tabular data using `read_csv()`.

## Presentation of the SAFI Data

The data set used movieSerie.csv is list of movies and series from IMDB. Each 
row holds information for a single movie or serie, and the columns
represent:

| column_name | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|id | Added to provide a unique Id for each observation. |
| title | Village name |
| type | Date of interview |
| description | How many members in the household? |
| genre | What type of walls does their house have (from list) |
| release_year | How many meals do people in your household normally eat in a day? |
|age_certification||
|runtime||
|seasons||
|imdb_id||
|imdb_score||
|imdb_votes||
|tmdb_popularity||
|tmdb_score||


## Importing data

You are going load the data in R's memory using the function `read_csv()`
from the **`readr`** package, which is part of the **`tidyverse`**; learn
more about the **`tidyverse`** collection of packages
[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
**`readr`** gets installed as part as the **`tidyverse`** installation.
When you load  the **`tidyverse`** (`library(tidyverse)`), the core packages
(the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded, including **`readr`**.

Before we can use the `read_csv()` we need to load the tidyverse package.

```{r, eval = TRUE,  message = FALSE, purl = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

After this we can read in the data set.

```{r, eval = TRUE,  message = FALSE, purl = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
movieSerie <- read_csv("data/movieSerie.csv", na = c("NA", "NULL"))
```

The first argument `read_csv` takes is the path to til file. The specific path 
is dependent on the specific setup. If you have followed the recommendations 
for structuring your project-folder, it should be the above command.

If you recall, the missing data is encoded as "NULL" in the dataset. With the 
second argument we tell R to automatically convert all the "NULL" entries in 
the dataset into `NA`.




If you were to type in the code above, it is likely that the `read.csv()`
function would appear in the automatically populated list of functions. This
function is different from the `read_csv()` function, as it is included in the
"base" packages that come pre-installed with R. Overall, `read.csv()` behaves
similar to `read_csv()`, with a few notable differences. First, `read.csv()`
coerces column names with spaces and/or special characters to different names
(e.g. `interview date` becomes `interview.date`). Second, `read.csv()`
stores data as a `data.frame`, where `read_csv()` stores data as a `tibble`.
We prefer tibbles because they have nice printing properties among other
desirable qualities. Read more about tibbles
[here](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).


The second statement in the code above creates a data frame but doesn't output
any data because, as you might recall, assignments (`<-`) don't display
anything. (Note, however, that `read_csv` may show informational
text about the data frame that is created.) If we want to check that our data
has been loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name:
`interviews` in the console.

```{r, results = 'hold', purl = FALSE}
movieSerie
## Try also
## view(interviews)
## head(interviews)
```

> ## Note
>
> `read_csv()` assumes that fields are delimited by commas. However, in several
> countries, the comma is used as a decimal separator and the semicolon (;) is
> used as a field delimiter. If you want to read in this type of files in R,
> you can use the `read_csv2` function. It behaves exactly like `read_csv` but
> uses different parameters for the decimal and the field separators. If you are
> working with another format, they can be both specified by the user. Check out
> the help for `read_csv()` by typing `?read_csv` to learn more. There is also
> the `read_tsv()` for tab-separated data files, and `read_delim()` allows you
> to specify more details about the structure of your file.

Note that `read_csv()` actually loads the data as a tibble.
A tibble is an extension of `R` data frames used by the **`tidyverse`**. When
the data is read using `read_csv()`, it is stored in an object of class 
`tbl_df`, `tbl`,  and `data.frame`. You can see the class of an object with

```{r results = 'hold', purl = FALSE}
class(interviews)
```

As a `tibble`, the type of data included in each column is listed in an
abbreviated fashion below the column names. For instance, here `key_ID` is a
column of floating point numbers (abbreviated `<dbl>` for the word 'double'),
`village` is a column of characters (`<chr>`) and the `interview_date` is a 
column in the "date and time" format (`<dttm>`).

## Inspecting data frames

When calling a `tbl_df` object (like `interviews` here), there is already a lot
of information about our data frame being displayed such as the number of rows,
the number of columns, the names of the columns, and as we just saw the class of
data stored in each column. However, there are functions to extract this
information from data frames.  Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of these
functions. Let's try them out!

Size:  

* `dim(interviews)` - returns a vector with the number of rows as the first
element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
the object)
* `nrow(interviews)` - returns the number of rows
* `ncol(interviews)` - returns the number of columns

Content: 

* `head(interviews)` - shows the first 6 rows
* `tail(interviews)` - shows the last 6 rows

Names: 

* `names(interviews)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for
`data.frame` objects)

Summary:  

* `str(interviews)` - structure of the object and information about the class,
length and content of each column
* `summary(interviews)` - summary statistics for each column
* `glimpse(interviews)` - returns the number of columns and rows of the tibble,
the names and class of each column, and previews as many values will fit on the
screen. Unlike the other inspecting functions listed above, `glimpse()` is not a
"base R" function so you need to have the `dplyr` or `tibble` packages loaded to
be able to execute it.

Note: most of these functions are "generic." They can be used on other types of
objects besides data frames or tibbles.


## Indexing and subsetting data frames

Our `interviews` data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions).
In practice, we may not need the entire data frame; for instance, we may only
be interested in a subset of the observations (the rows) or a particular set
of variables (the columns). If we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers.

> ## Tip
> Indexing a `tibble` with `[` or `[[` or `$` always results in a `tibble`.
> However, note this is not true in general for data frames, so be careful!
> Different ways of specifying these coordinates can lead to results with
> different classes. This is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson
> [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).

```{r, purl = FALSE}
## first element in the first column of the tibble
interviews[1, 1]

## first element in the 6th column of the tibble 
interviews[1, 6]

## first column of the tibble (as a vector)
interviews[[1]]

## first column of the tibble
interviews[1]

## first three elements in the 7th column of the tibble
interviews[1:3, 7]

## the 3rd row of the tibble
interviews[3, ]

## equivalent to head_interviews <- head(interviews)
head_interviews <- interviews[1:6, ]
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews[, -1]          # The whole tibble, except the first column

interviews[-c(7:131), ]   # Equivalent to head(interviews)
```

`tibble`s can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by
calling their column names directly:

```{r result_is_a_tibble, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
interviews["village"]       # Result is a tibble

interviews[, "village"]     # Result is a tibble

interviews[["village"]]     # Result is a vector

interviews$village          # Result is a vector
```

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct
names of the columns.

> ## Exercise
>
> 1. Create a tibble (`interviews_100`) containing only the data in
>    row 100 of the `interviews` dataset.
>
> 2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in the tibble?
>
>      * Use that number to pull out just that last row in the tibble.
>      * Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make
>        sure it's meeting expectations.
>      * Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
>      * Create a new tibble (`interviews_last`) from that last row.
>
> 3. Using the number of rows in the interviews dataset that you found in
>    question 2, extract the row that is in the middle of the dataset. Store
>    the content of this middle row in an object named `interviews_middle`.
>    (hint: This dataset has an odd number of rows, so finding the middle is a
>    bit trickier than dividing n_rows by 2. Use the median( ) function and what
>    you've learned about sequences in R to extract the middle row!
>
> 4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
>    `head(interviews)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the
>    interviews dataset.
