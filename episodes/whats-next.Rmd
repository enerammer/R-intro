# What should I do next?

## Great data
First of all: If you do not have data you want to work with 
already. Find some!

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) host competitions 
in machine learning. For the use of those competitions, they
give access to a lot of interesting datasets to work with.
With more than 200.000 datasets at time of writing, it can
be a bit overwhelming, so consider looking at the "[datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv)" available as CSV-files. 


## Great books

Many exists, some are available online, some are even free!

Our favorite is [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund. 

## Great sites

Most of the larger sites offering online courses in "something-with-data" offers courses that can support your 
learning in regards to exploratory data analysis:
