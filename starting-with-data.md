## What are data frames and tibbles?

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for tabular data in `R`, and what
we use for data processing, statistics, and plotting.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Data frames are analogous to
the more familiar spreadsheet in programs such as Excel, with one key difference.
Because columns are vectors,
each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![A 3 by 3 data frame with columns showing numeric, character and logical values.](fig/data-frame.svg){alt = 'A 3 by 3 data frame with columns showing numeric, character and logical values.'}

As shown in the previous lesson data frames can be created by hand, but most 
commonly they are generated by functions eg. `read_csv()` or `read_table()` 
- in other words, by importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web). 
We will now demonstrate how to import tabular data using `read_csv()`.

## Presentation of the movie_series dataset

The data set we will import is movie_series.csv. It is list of movies and series 
from IMDB and the movie database. Each row holds information for a single movie 
or serie, and the columns represent:

| column_name | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|id | Added to provide a unique Id for each observation. |
| title | The title of the movie or serie |
| type | Wether the row represents a movie or a serie |
| description | A short description of the movie or serie |
| genre | What genre the movie or serie is |
| release_year | When the movie or serie was released |
|age_certification| What age is the movie or serie appropriate for |
|runtime| How long the movie or serie is |
|seasons| How many seasons there are in a serie |
|imdb_id| A unique Id from the IMDB database|
|imdb_score| The score of the movie or serie in the IMDB database|
|imdb_votes| The number of votes in the IMDB database |
|tmdb_popularity| The popularity of the movie or serie in the movie database |
|tmdb_score| The score of the movie or serie in the movie database |


## Importing data

You are going load the data in R's memory using the function `read_csv()`
from the **`readr`** package, which is part of the **`tidyverse`**; learn
more about the **`tidyverse`** [collection of packages
here](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
**`readr`** gets installed as part as the **`tidyverse`** installation.
When you load  the **`tidyverse`** (`library(tidyverse)`), the core packages
(the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded, including **`readr`**.

##read.csv() vs. read_csv()

If you were to type in the code above, it is likely that the `read.csv()`
function would appear in the automatically populated list of functions. This
function is different from the `read_csv()` function, as it is included in the
"base" packages that come pre-installed with R. Overall, `read.csv()` behaves
similar to `read_csv()`, with a few notable differences. First, `read.csv()`
coerces column names with spaces and/or special characters to different names
(e.g. `interview date` becomes `interview.date`). Second, `read.csv()`
stores data as a `data.frame`, where `read_csv()` stores data as a `tibble`.
We prefer tibbles because they have nice printing properties among other
desirable qualities. [Read more about tibbles here](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).

::::::

Before we can use the `read_csv()` we need to load the tidyverse package.


``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

After this we can read in the data set.


``` r
movie_series <- read_csv("data/movie_series.csv", na = c("NA", "NULL"))
```

:::: callout

## Note

`read_csv()` assumes that fields are delimited by commas. However, in several
countries, the comma is used as a decimal separator and the semicolon (;) is
used as a field delimiter. If you want to read in this type of files in R,
you can use the `read_csv2` function. It behaves exactly like `read_csv` but
uses different parameters for the decimal and the field separators. If you are
working with another format, they can be both specified by the user. Check out
the help for `read_csv()` by typing `?read_csv` to learn more. There is also
the `read_tsv()` for tab-separated data files, and `read_delim()` allows you
to specify more details about the structure of your file.

::::::

The first argument `read_csv` takes is the path to til file. The specific path 
is dependent on the specific setup. If you have followed the recommendations 
for structuring your project-folder, it should be the above command.

If you recall, a dataset can include missing values. They can be represented in 
different ways, so the secsecond argument tell R to automatically convert all 
the "NULL" or "NA" entries in the dataset into `NA`.

By using `<-` we assign the dataset to the object `movie_series`. Because we 
assign the data frame to an object no outpu is created. If we want to check that our data
has been loaded, we can see the content of the data frame by typing its name:
`movie_series` in the console.


::::instructor
Why do we use `<-` instead of `=`? 

`=` works for assigning values to objects. However `=` is also used when we
specify values of arguments in function calls. This means that `=` functions differently depending on context, whereas `<-` always function in the same way.
This means that we do not have to have a deeper understanding of the context when
we encounter `<-`. That reduces the cognitive load, and we are stressed enough 
as it is.

```


Note that `read_csv()` actually loads the data as a tibble.
A tibble is an extension of `R` data frames used by the **`tidyverse`**. When
the data is read using `read_csv()`, it is stored in an object of class 
`tbl_df`, `tbl`,  and `data.frame`. You can see the class of an object with


``` r
class(movie_series)
```

``` output
[1] "spec_tbl_df" "tbl_df"      "tbl"         "data.frame" 
```

As a `tibble`, the type of data included in each column is listed in an
abbreviated fashion below the column names. For instance, here `runtime` is a
column of floating point numbers (abbreviated `<dbl>` for the word 'double'), 
and `title` is a column of characters (`<chr>`).

## Inspecting data frames

When calling a `tbl_df` object (like `movie_series` here), there is already a lot
of information about our data frame being displayed such as the number of rows,
the number of columns, the names of the columns, and as we just saw the class of
data stored in each column. However, there are functions to extract this
information from data frames.  Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of these
functions. Let's try them out!

Size:  

* `dim(movie_series)` - returns a vector with the number of rows as the first
element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
the object)
* `nrow(movie_series)` - returns the number of rows
* `ncol(movie_series)` - returns the number of columns

Content: 

* `head(movie_series)` - shows the first 6 rows
* `tail(movie_series)` - shows the last 6 rows

Names: 

* `names(movie_series)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for
`data.frame` objects)

Summary:  

* `str(movie_series)` - structure of the object and information about the class,
length and content of each column
* `summary(movie_series)` - summary statistics for each column
* `glimpse(movie_series)` - returns the number of columns and rows of the tibble,
the names and class of each column, and previews as many values will fit on the
screen. Unlike the other inspecting functions listed above, `glimpse()` is not a
"base R" function so you need to have the `dplyr` or `tibble` packages loaded to
be able to execute it.

Note: most of these functions are "generic." They can be used on other types of
objects besides data frames or tibbles.


## Indexing and subsetting data frames

Our `movie_series` data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions).
In practice, we may not need the entire data frame; for instance, we may only
be interested in a subset of the observations (the rows) or a particular set
of variables (the columns) - just as we did with vectors in 1 dimension. If we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers.


``` r
## first element in the first column of the tibble
movie_series[1, 1]
```

``` output
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  id      
  <chr>

``` r
## first element in the 6th column of the tibble 
movie_series[1, 6]
```

``` output

``` r

`:` is a special operator that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:


``` r
movie_series[, -1]          # The whole tibble, except the first column
```

``` output
# A tibble: 5,850 × 13

`tibble`s can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by
calling their column names directly:


``` r
movie_series["title"]       # Result is a tibble

movie_series[, "title"]     # Result is a tibble

movie_series[["title"]]     # Result is a vector

movie_series$title          # Result is a vector
```

In Positron, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct
names of the columns.

## Tip
Indexing a `tibble` with `[` or `[[` or `$` always results in a `tibble`.
However, note this is not true in general for data frames, so be careful!
Different ways of specifying these coordinates can lead to results with
different classes. This is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson
[R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Exercise

1. Create a tibble (`movie_series_100`) containing only the data in row 100 of 
the `movie_series` dataset.

2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in the tibble?
      * Use that number to pull out just that last row in the tibble.
      * Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make
        sure it's meeting expectations.
      * Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
      * Create a new tibble (`movie_series_last`) from that last row.

3. Using the number of rows in the movie_series dataset that you found in 
question 2, extract the row that is in the middle of the dataset. Store the 
content of this middle row in an object named `movie_series_middle`.

(hint: This dataset has an odd number of rows, so finding the middle is a
bit trickier than dividing n_rows by 2. Use the median( ) function and what
you've learned about sequences in R to extract the middle row!

4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
    `head(interviews)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the
    interviews dataset.
