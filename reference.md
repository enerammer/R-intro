## Glossary

The pipe, |>, is made using ctrl+shift+m on a windows computer. On a mac use
option+shift+m.

Vertical line, |, used as an OR-operator is found next to the backspace on the right
of the windows keyboard. Press the AltGr key and the key next to backspace to get
it. 
On a mac we have some succes pressing option+i. Confusingly | is also sometime 
called a pipe, because it performs a similar function in most Linux and Unix settings.

lot of optimation has happened behind the scenes. Since a lot of work has been
put into making the two different types of data structures compatible, the names
are used interchangeably, but note that there are some subtle differences.

Positron has a lot of functionalities. Though, it can be difficult to remember 
all the useful functions in the packages, not to mention the functions just in R.
