## Glossary

The pipe, |>, is made using ctrl+shift+m on a windows computer. On a mac use
option+shift+m.

Vertical line, |, used as an OR-operator is found next to the backspace on the right
of the windows keyboard. Press the AltGr key and the key next to backspace to get

On a mac we have some succes pressing option+i. Confusingly | is also sometime 
called a pipe, because it performs a similar function in most Linux and Unix settings.

are used interchangeably, but note that there are some subtle differences.

RStudio has a lot of functionality. And it can be difficult to remember 
all the useful functions in the packages, not to mention the functions just in R.

Making handy cheat sheets is a cottage industry in the R-world, and here are
